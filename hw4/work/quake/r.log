Error in est.cov(cov) : 
  Cannot identify reliable trusted k-mer coverage peak. Please verify the integrity of your dataset (e.g. by running kmer_hist.r). If there is no clear trusted k-mer distribution, the coverage is too low to correct these reads. If there is, please e-mail dakelley@umiacs.umd.edu and choose the cutoff by hand in the meantime
